### About

CumFX is a completely new JS library with only the groundworks laid.
This original idea came from me and a buddy. 
I wanted to make a JavaScript Library with a funny name. 
It also a side project Im going to use to better my JavaScript 
knowledge and have fun at the same time.

#### More stuff coming soon.

### How to import library

There are two main ways of using CumFX. The first is probably the simpler but to each his own.

The first one is using the script tag and getting it 
directly from the GitHub repo.bb

Like this: `<script src="link to script"><script>`

The second one is downloading the library on your machine 
and linking it directly.

Like this: `<script src="/js/libs/cumfx.js"><script>`

Download shit.
