# CumFX

---

### About

CumFX is a completely new JS library with only the groundworks laid.
More stuff coming soon.

Your mother is a testing bench.

### How to import library

There are two main ways of using CumFX. The first is probably the simpler but to each his own.

The first one is using the script tag and getting it 
directly from the GitHub repo.bb

Like this: `<script src="link to script"><script>`

The second one is downloading the library on your machine 
and linking it directly.

Like this: `<script src="/js/libs/cumfx.js"><script>`

Download shit.
